      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          A person (pl.: people or persons, depending on context) is a being who has certain capacities or attributes such as reason,
          morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as
          kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility.[1][2][3][4] The defining features of personhood and, consequently,
          what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts.[5][6]
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about
          personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what
          makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plural form “people” is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in “a people”), and this was the original
          meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. The plural form “persons” is often used in
          philosophical and legal writing.
        </p>

      <section id="personhood">
        <h2>Personhood</h2>
        <p>
          Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied
          to legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a
          natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability. Personhood continues
          to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of slavery and the fight for women's rights, in
          debates about abortion, fetal rights, and in animal rights advocacy.[7][6]
        </p>
        <p>
          Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of women,
          and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, postnatal humans are defined as persons. Likewise, certain
          legal entities such as corporations, sovereign states and other polities, or estates in probate are legally defined as persons.[8]
          However, some people believe that other groups should be included; depending on the theory, the category of “person” may be taken to
          include or not pre-natal humans or such non-human entities as animals, artificial intelligences, or extraterrestrial life.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="identity">
        <h2>Personal identity</h2>
        <p>
          Personal identity is the unique identity of persons through time—that is, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person
          at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the same person, persisting through time. In the modern philosophy of mind,
          this is sometimes called the diachronic problem of personal identity. The synchronic problem concerns which features characterize a
          given person at one time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proposed solutions include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or
          memory,[9] the bundle theory of self,[10] continuity of personality after death,[11] and views that deny there are persisting persons.

      <section id="development">
        <h2>Development of the concept</h2>
        <p>
          In ancient Rome, the word <em>persona</em> (Latin) or <em>prosopon</em> (Ancient Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by
          actors on stage, representing the “personae” in the play.[12] The concept was further developed during Trinitarian and Christological
          debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to “nature”.[13]
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Jörg Noller, approaches range from Boethius’ ontological definition, Locke’s self-consciousness account, Kant’s moral
          end-in-itself, animalism (Olson), constitution theory (Baker), and Schechtman’s “person life”, among others.[14] Other theories draw
          on value theory, e.g., Kelly’s “richness” account of why humans/animals are valued as persons.[15]
